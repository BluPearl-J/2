#2.8 (Table of Squares and Cubes) Write a script that calculates the squares and cubes
#of the numbers from 0 to 5. Print the resulting values in table format, as shown below. Use
#the tab escape sequence to achieve the three-column output.
#number square cube 
#0 0 0
#1 1 1
#2 4 8
#3 9 27
#4 16 64
#5 25 125
#The next chapter shows how to “right align” numbers. You could try that as an extra challenge here. The output would be:
#number square cube 
# 0 0 0
#1 1 1
#2 4 8
#3 9 27
#4 16 64
#5 25 125

## Example  \t to space tabs in python
#print("Name\tAge\tCity")
